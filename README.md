## Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
As imple automated system designed to detect Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal fundus images using deep learning, aimed at supporting early diagnosis and reducing preventable vision loss.
## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System is a deep learning–based project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically analyze retinal fundus images and classify the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Early detection of DR is critical for preventing blindness, but traditional screening methods rely heavily on manual evaluation by ophthalmologists, which is time-consuming and prone to human error. This system addresses these challenges by providing a fast, scalable, and highly accurate automated screening tool. The model learns to identify important retinal features such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates directly from images, improving diagnostic support for healthcare providers.
